# eOlympian
The eOlympian is a Suzuki S-32-II 'Olympian' electric conversion.
It began when I was looking for an electric conversino project, and remembered the 1966 Suzuki S32-II in my basement.  I had purchased it many years ago as a basket case, and it was missing the cylinder jugs, exhaust pipes, and seat, as well as some miscillaneous hardware.  Not really wanting to go on a parts hunt for a full restore, I decided to go with a resto-mod.

This repo is here to manage as much as I can about this project.  I plan to store most of the CAD, software, etc here as I can.
